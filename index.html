<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I love to sing and edit videos. I love to learn about true crime and stories about how a persons childhood can shape them into becoming a serial killer. When I leave uni, I would love to incorparate my passion of editing and creating videos to make true crime documentaries. I also enjoy listening to music and baking.</p>
<p> During my audio class, I had to record some sounds, here is an example of one.</p>
